										<hr><h3> Migration from a monolithic architecture to a hybrid architecture based on microservices.</h3><hr>
										<span class="image left"><br><br><img src="../../images/research1.webp" alt="" /></span>
										<h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote style="text-align: justify">Microservices architecture is an approach based on the construction of systems as independent suites of services. However, its adoption can have some complex aspects, one of them, is the migration from legacy architectures. The objective of this research is to define the possible guidelines for a correct migration towards hybrid cloud services in a given case study. The case study is a Centralized Laboratories Management System (CLMS), which works as part of a set of systems in a Tertiary Educational Institution (TEI). This article covered the main challenges in cloud technologies such as security, performance, interoperability and monitoring, ensuring that the new architecture offers flexibility with the current servers, scalability for future updates, and resilience for quality of service.</blockquote>

										<hr><h3>Software Architecture Design for a Vote counting system focus on high availability.</h3><hr>
										<span class="image left"><br><br><img src="../../images/research2.webp" alt="" /></span>
										<h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote style="text-align: justify">Electoral systems in several governments and countries have faced different issues in terms of security and availability in their vote counting systems. Considering the process and storage of sensitive data during the election period, a high availability system based on microservices is proposed. The resilience capacity, continuous delivery and flexibility for audit of microservices are suitable for these scenarios. The main purpose for this research is design adequate software architecture system views, which include features such as vote counting, transmission in real time of data processing, geolocation of counting points, ability to monitor transactions in the system and reports generation. Following the 4+1 architectural view model, it was possible to obtain truthful results based on different viewpoints of stakeholders.</blockquote>

										<hr><h3>Interaction design testing based on human cognitive type: A case study.</h3><hr>
										<span class="image left"><br><br><img src="../../images/research3.webp" alt="" /></span>
										<h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote style="text-align: justify">The relation between computing systems and human cognitive interaction has become in the main objective of several research. There is different classification of cognitive styles due to the abstraction of information is unique for each person. In this context, this article examines the behaviour interaction generated by the features of a software application over different users (field dependent or field independent). The application features have been analysed considering visual and haptic theories, to identify the favourable and deficient aspects of the case study. Through the results obtained, it can be said that navigation design achieves the minimum interaction parameters to make felt comfortable the participants. However, several aspects of the application design were not perceived by the field dependent participants.</blockquote>

										<hr><h3>Analysis of heart rate variability during habitual caffeine drinks ingestion.</h3><hr>
										<span class="image left"><br><br><img src="../../images/research4.webp" alt="" /></span>
										<h4>Abstract</h4><blockquote style="text-align: justify">Experimental studies in different scenarios have clarified the effects of caffeine on the human body over the years. This study focuses on the consumption of coffee and its effect on resting heart rate, the variation is analyzed through the standard deviation in a set of participants considering two stages for increase the results accuracy. The findings verified an effect of tolerance to caffeine in habitual coffee consumers, and a direct relationship with the health background of the participants. In addition, a dangerous increase in heart beats per minute with standard coffee doses has not been found.</blockquote>
